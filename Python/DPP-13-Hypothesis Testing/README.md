# 📊 Hypothesis Testing – Statistical Decision Making

### DA Session 10 – Z-Test & One-Sample t-Test

## 📌 Project Overview

This module focuses on applying **hypothesis testing techniques** to evaluate business claims, performance improvements, and quality control scenarios.

The assignment includes:

* One-sample Z-test
* One-sample t-test
* One-tailed hypothesis testing
* Two-tailed hypothesis testing
* Significance levels (α = 0.05, 0.01)
* Business interpretation of statistical results

# 📂 Topics Covered

---

## 🔹 1. One-Sample Z-Test

### Concepts:

* Testing population mean with known/large sample size
* Significance level (5%)
* Improvement evaluation

### Real-Life Scenario:

* Customer satisfaction improvement after implementing a new feedback process

**Learning Focus:**
Determine whether observed improvement is statistically significant or due to random variation.

---

## 🔹 2. One-Tailed Hypothesis Testing

### Scenario:

* School claims students perform better than national average

### Concepts:

* Right-tailed test
* Significance level 0.01
* Verifying performance claims

**Learning Focus:**
Understanding directional hypothesis testing.

---

## 🔹 3. One-Sample t-Test (Small Sample Size)

### Scenario:

* Retail store testing increase in daily sales
* Small sample size (n = 15)

### Concepts:

* t-distribution
* Unknown population standard deviation
* 5% significance level

**Learning Focus:**
Using t-test when sample size is small.
