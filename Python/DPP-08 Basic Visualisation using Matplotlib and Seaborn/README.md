Maine tumhara sixth PDF **“Basic Visualisation using Matplotlib and Seaborn”** analyse kar liya hai 

Yeh ek proper **Data Visualization Mini Project (Titanic Dataset)** hai.
Isko GitHub pe simple questions ki list ki tarah nahi, ek structured visualization project ki tarah present karna chahiye.

Neeche tumhare liye **portfolio-ready README format (no solutions)** 👇

# 🚢 Titanic Data Visualization Project

### Basic Visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring and visualizing the famous **Titanic dataset** using Python visualization libraries such as **Matplotlib and Seaborn**.

The objective is to understand passenger distribution, survival patterns, correlations, and demographic trends through various types of charts.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python 3**
* **NumPy** → Numerical computations
* **Pandas** → Data manipulation
* **Matplotlib** → Basic plotting
* **Seaborn** → Advanced statistical visualization

Dataset loaded using:
`seaborn.load_dataset("titanic")`

---

# 📂 Project Tasks

---

## 🔹 1. Data Loading & Inspection

**Objectives:**

* Load the Titanic dataset using Seaborn
* Display first 5 rows
* Check total number of rows and columns

**Skills Applied:**
Dataset exploration
Shape & structure analysis

---

## 🔹 2. Bar Chart – Passenger Class Distribution

**Objective:**
Create a bar chart showing number of passengers in each passenger class (`pclass`).

**Focus:**

* Class-wise distribution
* Labeling & titles

**Insight Goal:**
Understand class demographics of passengers.

---

## 🔹 3. Boxplot – Age Distribution by Class

**Objective:**
Plot a boxplot of `age` across different passenger classes (`pclass`).

**Insight Goal:**
Compare age spread, median age, and outliers across classes.

---

## 🔹 4. Heatmap – Correlation Analysis

**Objective:**
Create a heatmap showing correlations among numerical features:

* age
* fare
* sibsp
* parch

**Insight Goal:**
Identify strongest relationships between variables.

---

## 🔹 5. Pie Chart – Survival Proportion

**Objective:**
Create a pie chart showing proportion of passengers who:

* Survived
* Did not survive

**Insight Goal:**
Understand overall survival distribution.

---

## 🔹 6. Scatterplot – Age vs Fare (Gender-wise)

**Objective:**
Create a scatterplot of:

* `age` vs `fare`
* Colored by `sex`

**Insight Goal:**
Analyze spending patterns across genders and age groups.

---

## 🔹 7. Histogram – Age Distribution

**Objective:**
Plot a histogram (`histplot`) of `age` using bins of size 10.

**Insight Goal:**
Understand age distribution patterns (skewness, clusters, etc.).

---

## 🔹 8. Line Chart – Age vs Average Fare

**Objective:**

* Group dataset by `age`
* Calculate average `fare` per age
* Plot line chart showing trend

**Insight Goal:**
Identify relationship between age and average fare paid.

# 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

* Data visualization fundamentals
* Choosing appropriate chart types
* Interpreting visual insights
* Correlation analysis
* Demographic trend analysis
