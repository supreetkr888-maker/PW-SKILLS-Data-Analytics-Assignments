🐍 Lambda Functions, Error Handling & Modules
Python Practice Set – Intermediate Concepts

This practice set focuses on intermediate Python concepts including:

Lambda Functions

Error Handling (Exception Handling)

Built-in Modules (math, random)

Custom Modules

The problems are divided into Easy, Medium, and Hard levels to gradually strengthen understanding of functional programming and exception handling.

🔹 Easy Level
1️⃣ Understanding Lambda Functions

Objective:
Explain what a lambda function is in Python and mention two reasons why it is useful.

Concepts Covered:

Anonymous functions

Short inline function expressions

Functional programming basics

2️⃣ Lambda Function – Square of a Number

Objective:
Create a lambda function that takes a number as input and returns its square.

Test Case:
Input: 5
Expected Output: 25

Concepts Covered:

Lambda syntax

Single-expression functions

3️⃣ Using the Math Module

Objective:
Import the math module and print the value of π (pi).

Expected Output:
3.141592653589793

Concepts Covered:

Module importing

Built-in Python libraries

🔹 Medium Level
4️⃣ Lambda with List Transformation

Objective:
Use a lambda function to double all numbers in a given list.

Given List:
[2, 4, 6, 8]

Expected Output:
[4, 8, 12, 16]

Concepts Covered:

Lambda with list operations

Functional transformation

5️⃣ Division with Error Handling

Objective:
Create a program that asks the user to divide two numbers and handles the case where division by zero occurs using try-except.

Test Case:
Number 1 = 10
Number 2 = 0

Expected Output:
Error: Cannot divide by zero.

Concepts Covered:

Exception handling

ZeroDivisionError

try-except block

6️⃣ Random Number Generator

Objective:
Use the random module to generate and print a random number between 1 and 10.

Expected Output:
A number between 1 and 10 (e.g., 7)

Concepts Covered:

Random module

Built-in libraries

🔹 Hard Level
7️⃣ Lambda with filter()

Objective:
Use a lambda function along with filter() to extract even numbers from the list:

Given List:
[3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18]

Expected Output:
[6, 12, 18]

Concepts Covered:

Higher-order functions

filter()

Functional programming

8️⃣ Advanced Error Handling

Objective:
Take two user inputs and perform division. Handle:

ValueError (if input is not numeric)

ZeroDivisionError

Test Case:
Number 1 = "abc"
Number 2 = 0

Expected Output:

Error: Invalid input. Please enter numbers only.

Error: Cannot divide by zero.

Concepts Covered:

Multiple exception handling

Robust input validation

9️⃣ Creating and Using a Custom Module

Objective:
Create a Python module named my_module.py containing a function greet(name) that prints:

Hello, <name>!

Then write another program to import this module and call the function with:

name = "Aman"

Expected Output:
Hello, Aman!

Concepts Covered:

Creating custom modules

Importing user-defined modules

Code modularity
