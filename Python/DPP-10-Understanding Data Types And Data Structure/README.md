# 📚 DPP: Understanding Data Types & Data Sources

### 5-Day Learning Sprint – Theory + Implementation + Interview Prep

## 📌 Project Overview

This 5-day structured practice module focuses on understanding:

* Data Types
* Data Structures
* Data Sources (Structured, Semi-Structured, Unstructured)
* Real-life system design applications
* Interview preparation

The objective is to build both **conceptual clarity and practical implementation skills** required for data analytics and backend systems.

# 🗓 Day 1: Understanding Data Types

## 🎯 Objective

Understand primitive and non-primitive data types and their importance in programming.

### 🔹 Theory Focus

* Difference between primitive & non-primitive data types
* Importance of choosing correct data types
* Impact of data types on memory & performance
* Characteristics of strings

### 🔹 Practical Task

Build a Python program that:

* Accepts integer, float, string, boolean inputs
* Identifies their data types using `type()`
* Stores them in a dictionary with data type names as keys

**Deliverable:** Python code + output screenshot

---

# 🗓 Day 2: Data Structures & Applications

## 🎯 Objective

Understand how core data structures solve real-world problems.

### 🔹 Theory Focus

* Array vs Linked List
* Stack (LIFO principle)
* Hash Map vs Array
* Queue (real-world applications like ticketing systems)

### 🔹 Practical Task

Implement a simple **Ticketing System using Queue**:

* Enqueue new ticket requests
* Dequeue processed tickets
* View next ticket
* Display total tickets in queue

**Deliverable:** Python code with sample input/output

# 🗓 Day 3: Structured, Semi-Structured & Unstructured Data

## 🎯 Objective

Differentiate between types of data and their real-world applications.

### 🔹 Theory Focus

* Structured data (e.g., CSV, database tables)
* Semi-structured data (e.g., JSON, APIs)
* Unstructured data (e.g., text, images, videos)
* Challenges in processing unstructured data

### 🔹 Practical Task

* Collect structured data (CSV)
* Load semi-structured data (JSON)
* Describe approach to process unstructured data using NLP or image recognition

**Deliverable:** Python code + summary of findings

---

# 🗓 Day 4: Real-Life Project – E-Commerce System

## 🎯 Objective

Apply data types, structures, and data sources in a practical system design.

### 📦 Case Study

Design a simple backend system handling:

* Product Catalog (structured data)
* User Reviews (semi-structured JSON)
* Product Images (unstructured data)

### 🔹 Tasks

* Design product catalog structure (e.g., list of dictionaries)
* Simulate JSON reviews & analyze ratings
* Outline process for handling product images & metadata

**Deliverable:**

* Python implementation
* Flow explanation for image handling

---

# 🗓 Day 5: Interview Preparation

## 🎯 Objective

Strengthen conceptual clarity and prepare for technical interviews.

### 🔹 Theory Focus

* Explaining data types using simple analogies
* Choosing correct data structures
* APIs & semi-structured data exchange

### 🔹 Practical Task

* Prepare short presentation on data types & sources
* Practice mock interview answers
* Record at least 3 responses

**Deliverable:** Slides + recorded answers

---

# 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

* Strong foundation in data types & structures
* Understanding of real-world data sources
* System design thinking
* Backend logic basics
* Interview-ready explanations
