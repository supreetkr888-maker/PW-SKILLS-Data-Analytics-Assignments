# 📊 Correlation Analysis & Feature Relationships

### DA Session 11 – Pearson, Spearman & Multivariate Insights

## 📌 Project Overview

This module focuses on understanding relationships between variables using correlation techniques.

It explores:

* Linear relationships
* Rank-based relationships
* Multivariate correlations
* Partial correlation
* Feature selection in regression

The objective is to strengthen analytical thinking required in **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and model building.**

# 📂 Topics Covered

---

## 🔹 1. Understanding Correlation

### Concepts:

* Definition of correlation
* Positive vs Negative correlation
* Strength of relationship
* Correlation range (-1 to +1)

### Real-Life Examples:

* Study hours vs test scores
* Advertising spend vs revenue
* Sales performance trends

---

## 🔹 2. Pearson Correlation

### Focus:

* Measuring linear relationships
* Interpretation of r and r²
* Manual calculation from small dataset
* Simulating strong correlation (e.g., r = 0.95)

### Learning Outcome:

Understand how strong linear relationships are quantified and interpreted.

---

## 🔹 3. Spearman Rank Correlation

### Focus:

* Rank-based correlation
* Non-linear monotonic relationships
* Comparison with Pearson

### Application:

* Ordered datasets
* Data with non-normal distribution

---

## 🔹 4. Correlation Heatmaps

### Focus:

* Correlation matrix creation
* Visual interpretation
* Identifying strong and weak feature relationships

### Learning Outcome:

Detect patterns and multicollinearity in datasets.

---

## 🔹 5. Partial Correlation

### Focus:

* Measuring relationship between X and Y while controlling for Z
* Understanding indirect vs direct effects

### Application:

* Eliminating confounding influence
* More accurate feature relationship analysis

---

## 🔹 6. Multicollinearity & Regression

### Topics:

* Why highly correlated variables cause issues in regression
* Impact on coefficient stability
* Feature selection importance

---

## 🔹 7. Confounding Variables

### Focus:

* Definition and impact
* Why correlation ≠ causation
* Real-world examples

---

# 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes
