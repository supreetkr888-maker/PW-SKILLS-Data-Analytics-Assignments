# 📊 Statistics Foundations – Measures of Central Tendency & Dispersion

### DA Session 7 – Practical & Conceptual Understanding

## 📌 Project Overview

This module focuses on understanding and applying fundamental statistical concepts used in data analysis and business decision-making.

The assignment explores real-life scenarios where measures like:

* Mean
* Median
* Mode
* Range
* Variance
* Standard Deviation

are used to interpret variability, consistency, and trends in data.

# 📂 Topics Covered

---

## 🔹 1. Measures of Central Tendency

### Concepts:

* Mean (Average)
* Median (Middle value)
* Mode (Most frequent value)

### Real-Life Applications Covered:

* Production analysis
* Student test scores
* Real estate pricing
* Health recovery time
* Survey responses

### Learning Focus:

* Choosing the most representative measure
* Impact of outliers on mean
* When median is preferred over mean
* Role of mode in categorical data

---

## 🔹 2. Measures of Dispersion

### Concepts:

* Range
* Variance
* Standard Deviation

### Real-Life Applications Covered:

* Homework time variability
* Greenhouse temperature control
* Factory production consistency
* Stock market volatility
* Business sales forecasting

### Learning Focus:

* Understanding variability in datasets
* Comparing consistency between two groups
* Risk analysis using standard deviation

---

## 🔹 3. Outliers & Skewed Data

### Key Scenarios:

* Extreme customer tips
* Income distribution with high earners
* Real estate pricing with luxury properties

### Learning Focus:

* How outliers distort mean
* Identifying skewed distributions
* Choosing robust statistical measures

---

## 🔹 4. Comparative Dataset Analysis

Scenarios include:

* Comparing score variability between classes
* Comparing variance between factories
* Comparing volatility between stocks

**Learning Outcome:**
Using dispersion measures to evaluate stability and predictability.

---

## 🔹 5. Combined Statistical Interpretation

Some problems require:

* Computing both mean & standard deviation
* Interpreting consistency + average together
* Making business or health decisions based on statistics

---
